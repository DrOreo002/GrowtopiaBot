# About
This is actually not made by me (DrOreo002) but I've edited the source so it will be compatible without QT and you can  
compile it using Visual Studio  

# Usage
It should be easy to build this, but apparently visual studio wouldn't allow you to. Because sometimes thing could go wrong
so I'd recommend to use **Visual Studio 2017** because its the version that I'm currently using

1. Change this [line](https://github.com/DrOreo002/GrowtopiaBot/blob/master/CPPBot/CPPBot.cpp#L27) to your exact path of the `.json` make sure you have double slash
2. Build in debug mode or release, up to you
3. Enjoy

**Bot data example**  
```json
{
  "username": "Dirgahayu",
  "password": "Indonesia75Tahun",
  "gameVersion": "3.011",
  "targetWorld": "INDONESIA",
  "ownerUsername": "DrOreo002"
}
```
