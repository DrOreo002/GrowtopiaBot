A simple growtopia bot! made by Growtopia Noobs

> !about (Show about message)

# About
This is actually not made by me (DrOreo002) but I've edited the source so it will be compatible without QT and you can  
compile it using Visual Studio  

# Usage
Afer you compiled the source, you can directly run the .exe file and specify the path for your bot data.
or you can directly run the debug .exe inside the Debug folder  

**Bot data example**  
```json
{
  "username": "Dirgahayu",
  "password": "Indonesia75Tahun",
  "gameVersion": "3.011",
  "targetWorld": "INDONESIA",
  "ownerUsername": "DrOreo002"
}
```
Also be aware that ownership is experimental. Sometimes it work, sometimes it dont. But I'll not release  
a fix here since I'm currently making my own bot in Java
