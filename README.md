# GrowtopiaBot
A simple growtopia bot! made by Growtopia Noobs

# About
This is actually not made by me (DrOreo002) but I've edited the source so it will be compatible without QT and you can  
compile it using Visual Studio  

# Usage
Afer you compiled the source, you can directly run the .exe file and specify the path for your bot data.

**Bot data example**  
```json
{
  "username": "HelloWorld",
  "password": "LMAO",
  "gameVersion": "2.999",
  "targetWorld": "DROREOITEM",
  "publicOwnership": "true"
}
```
Also be aware that ownership is experimental. Sometimes it work, sometimes it dont. But I'll not release  
a fix here since I'm currently making my own bot in Java
